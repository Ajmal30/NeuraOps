## :dart: NeuraOps

A lightweight, modular AI Agent built using LangGraph for workflow orchestration and Groq-powered LLaMA models for ultra-fast inference.
Supports multi-step reasoning, tool execution, memory, and structured outputs packaged as a Python backend service.

## :sparkles: Features

1. Agentic workflow using LangGraph (stateful nodes + conditional edges)

2. Low-latency LLaMA inference via Groq API

3. Custom tools for retrieval, reasoning, and structured tasks

4. Deterministic multi-step reasoning with LangGraph execution
